            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Shane Peterman. I'm currently a junior at UNF studying
                Information Systems. I'm also in the pathways program and plan to pursue<br>
                a Masters of Science in Computer Science. Here you can find Information
                about me like my hobbies, interest, education information as well as pages<br>
                for a class schedule and to create an account.
            </p>
            <p>Some interesting facts about me are that I'm 26 years old. I'm originally from
                Maryland but I've lived all over the United States. I've lived in Maryland,<br>
                New Mexico, Virginia and Florida. I moved to florida 7 years ago and eventually plan
                on moving somewhere with cooler weather like Colorado. One of my favorite things<br>
                about moving around the United States was the balloon fiesta in Albuquerque, NM
                which you can find information on in this link 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque_International_Balloon_Fiesta" target="_blank">here</a>.
